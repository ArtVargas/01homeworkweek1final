There were issues regarding the html that needed to be changed in order to have a fully functional website. I had issues with being able replace the div tags with semantic tags. I needed to showcase various semantic tags and attributes and put them in their correct place for proper functionality. I wanted to practice by trial and error to learn more about html and what to use in order to have everything be in the right place.

## User Story 
As a marketing agenct I WANT an accessible codebase SO THAT meets all the necessary standards for site optimization search engines
# Acceptance Crtiera 
WHEN I view the given source code
THEN I locate the HTML Semantic elements
WHEN I find the html structure of the elements
THEN I find that the elements showcase and follow a series of logical styling and positioning independence
WHEN I find the image elements
THEN I find all alternate attributes for accessibility 
WHEN I locate the heading attributes
THEN they all fall into sequential order
WHEN I see the title element 
THEN I find a precise title descriptive title
